# rb-07 Packages, Crates, Modules

## Things learned

- `Packages` can only have one `library` crate but
  many `binary` crates.
- A good reference to rules on modules can be found
  here: https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html#modules-cheat-sheet.
- To create a package from `cargo` we can use the line:
  `cargo new <libraryname> --lib`.
