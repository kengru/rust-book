# rb-15-4 Rc<T>.

## Things learned

- `Rc` stands for reference counting. The `Rc<T>` type keeps track
  of the number of references to a value to determine whether or not the
  value is still in use.
- We use the `Rc<T>` type when we want to allocate some data on the heap
  for multiple parts of our program to read and we canâ€™t determine at
  compile time which part will finish using the data last.
- In terms of performance the `Rc::clone()` is not the same as a regular
  copy of data, in this case it only increments the reference counts to
  that data.
- `Rc::strong_count()` counts all the reference to the specified data.
