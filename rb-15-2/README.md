# rb-15-2 Deref trait.

## Things learned

- When before a variable, `*` is called the `deref` operator.
  When multiplying is called the `glob` or `multiplication` operator.
- As I recall, traits are behaviours that you can define for
  types so that those types can be used in things like addition, comparition
  or several other operators, including `derefenciation`.
- The `Deref` trait needs a function called deref implemented
  in order for a type to be dereferenced.
