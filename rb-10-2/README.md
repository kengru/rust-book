# rb-10-2 Traits

## Things learned

- Traits define functionality of a particular type.
- Traits mainly define an interface, which is an
  implementation a type could have. They don't define
  the behaviour, its more like the end result.
- You can actually define a default behaviour too.
- We can use traits to define different function
  implementations into a same thing and then add them
  into a struct. If you don't expecify the behaviour
  of the trait function you are implementing then
  you need to add it when adding it to a struct.
  If you do, then it acts like a default implementation.
