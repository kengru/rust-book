# rb-06-1 Enum

## Things learned

- Enums are fairly simple, they work just like you would
  expect in another language.
- You can add types to the elements of the enum in order
  to store value in them.
- Methods can also be implemented with enums.
- Enums are cool.
- The `Option` type encodes the case when a value could be
  empty.
- `Option` is just how in typescript we handle values that
  could not be there in runtime, in this case, everytime you
  would want to use the value of an `Option`, you will have to
  make sure that the value is there.
