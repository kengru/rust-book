## Things learned

- `if` uses the same old things, including `else` and `else if`. Also
  uses double `=` for comparison. Doesn't need `()` in the condition.
- Ternary is something like this: `let number = if condition {5} else {6}`.
  The results return values of the condition must be of the same type.
- You can declare a variable with no value and then assigned one to it
  without using `let`.
