# Functions

## Things learned

- Accessing arrays with a wrong index will make the program panic.
- An array can only contain elements of a single type.
- Function names are conventionaly named as snake case.
- In Rust, it does not matter the order we define functions.
- Parameter would be the variable that is sent to a function, while
  argument would be the value of the parameter.
- All parameters need to be typed.
- Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an
  expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value. Keep this
  in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.
